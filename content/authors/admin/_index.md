I'm interested in the sensible and responsible use of data for public policy/development challenges. On the Mayur Vihar project, I work closely with Vikram (the main driving force for this work) to brainstorm, raise funds for, and implement activities. To complement Vikram's field knowledge and implementation experience, I help provide research inputs, good documentation and data collection experience.
