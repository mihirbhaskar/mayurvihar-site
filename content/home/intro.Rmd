```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, sp, leaflet, rgdal, maptools, tmap, stringr)
boundaries <- readOGR("D:/Dropbox/Mayur Vihar Project/Listing Survey/Data/Raw/Blocks for listing.kml",
                      require_geomType='wkbPolygon')


```

Community project in Mayur Vihar Phase-I, Delhi.


```{r boundary}

# Prepping and merging on survey data

#boundaries@data <- left_join(boundaries@data, survey, by = 'block_name') 


leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addPolygons(data = boundaries)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
