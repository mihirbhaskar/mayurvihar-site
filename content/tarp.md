## The issue

In the first week of June 2020, Delhi was hit by a deluge of heavy rain and wind. Given the type of temporary housing structures people in the Mayur Vihar community live in, it isn't surprising that this had a devastating effect for several families:

## What we did

To help families rebuild their destroyed huts, we purchased large waterproof tarpaulins to place on the thatched roofs. These tarps would help not only help protect the homes from wind and rain, but also serve a purpose during the harsh summers, to keep cool by blocking out sunlight.

**Each tarp cost INR 1,032, and we were able to raise enough to help 121 families (INR 1,24,870 in total).** Below are some pics of the distribution:
